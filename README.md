 # digitalhumanitiesproject
 This project is for the Computational Literacy course assignment

Humanities Research Questions
1.	How do memes on social media reinterpret or satirize literature?
2.	How do memes provide insights into modern readers’ engagement with literary works? 

Data Sources
For this project, Parsehub, a web scraping tool has been used to collect memes from publicly accessible pages on Instagram and Facebook for developing the dataset. The dataset comprises 50 memes referencing classic and contemporary literary works. Each meme in the dataset includes Meme ID, Literary authors, Caption text, Humor type, Theme/Motif, date and audience engagement metrics.
The data was extracted from specific hashtags and pages (e.g., #LiteraryMemes, #BookHumor, and similar literary content hubs) and exported into a structured CSV format.
