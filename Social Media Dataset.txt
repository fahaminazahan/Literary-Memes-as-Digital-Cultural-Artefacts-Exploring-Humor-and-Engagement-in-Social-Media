Instagram	F. Scott Fitzgerald	"Where does one begin? If you chance upon encountering a plebian who believes that Fitzgerald's masterpiece is merely ""a romance novel"" you should discard that person from your memory, similarly to how Nick discarded his dog, his Finnish cleaner, his engagement to a woman in the Midwest, and many other things from his immediate recollection. The brilliance of Fitzgerald is his amazing ability to incorporate real-life things into an imaginary setting. He expertly captures both the disillusion of post-war America and the moral failure of a society obsessed with nature. The complex love-triangle is only a base for the themes to grow and blossom on, and anyone who sees it as a clich‚ love story ought to go back to reading ""Biff, Chip & Kipper"" in primary school to learn about what makes a good story."
